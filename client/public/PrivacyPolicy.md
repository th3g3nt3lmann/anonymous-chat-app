*   Your chat messages.
*   Information about your browser or device.
*   Any form of tracking or analytics data.

## End-to-End Encryption

All communications on our platform are protected by end-to-end encryption. This means that from the moment you send a message to the moment it's received by your chat partner, it is completely encrypted. Only you and your chat partner have the keys to decrypt the messages.

## Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us.
